when cells were treated with il-4 for 5 hours before lps activation , both the c-fos and the c-jun mrna expression was decreased .
5,6 G#protein

the inhibition of c-fos and c-jun expression by il-4 in lps-treated cells was shown to be due to a lower transcription rate of the c-fos and c-jun genes .
3,4 G#DNA|8,9 G#protein|10,12 G#cell_type|24,25 G#DNA|26,28 G#DNA|24,28 G#DNA

il-4 did not affect the stability of the c-fos and c-jun transcripts .
0,1 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|10,12 G#protein

finally , using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , evidence was obtained that il-4 inhibits lps-induced expression of ap-1 protein .
12,13 G#protein|17,18 G#protein

these data indicate that il-4 suppresses the induction of transcription factors in human activated monocytes .

transient pseudohypoaldosteronism in obstructive renal disease with transient reduction of lymphocytic aldosterone receptors .
10,13 G#protein

results in two affected infants .


we report two patients with transient pseudohypoaldosteronism due to obstructive renal disease .


both patients presented with a salt-losing episode simulating adrenal insufficiency .


in one patient , transient reduction of aldosterone receptors could be documented , while in the second patient the clinical and biochemical parameters were consistent with transient pseudohypoaldosteronism .
7,9 G#protein

aldosterone receptors were normal in both patients

aldosterone-specific membrane receptors and rapid non-genomic actions of mineralocorticoids .
0,3 G#protein

functional studies in extrarenal , non-epithelial cells such as smooth muscle cells and more recently circulating human lymphocytes have provided increasing evidence that aldosterone produces not only classical genomic effects , but also rapid , non-genomic effects on transmembrane electrolyte movements .
3,7 G#cell_type|9,12 G#cell_type|16,18 G#cell_type|15,18 G#cell_type

these involve activation of the sodium/proton exchanger of the cell membrane at very low , physiological concentrations of aldosterone with an acute onset within 1-2 min .
5,7 G#protein

a second messenger cascade involved is the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate /calcium pathway which responds over the same rapid time course .


such changes clearly can not be explained by genomic mechanisms , which are responsible for later effects than the membrane related rapid responses .


the mechanisms underlying these rapid effects of aldosterone on electrolytes have been extensively studied in human lymphocytes , which thus may represent valuable tools in the delineation of the receptor-effector mechanisms involved .
15,17 G#cell_type

the unique characteristics of this new pathway for steroid action include its rapid time course , 10,000-fold selectivity for aldosterone over cortisol and the ineffectiveness of spironolactones , classical mineralocorticoid antagonists , as antagonists of the response .


human immunodeficiency virus type 1 nef protein inhibits nf-kappa b induction in human t cells .
0,7 G#protein|8,10 G#protein|12,15 G#cell_type

human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( hiv-1 ) can establish a persistent and latent infection in cd4+ t lymphocytes ( w.c.greene , n.engl.j. med.324 : 308-317 , 1991 ; s.m.schnittman , m.c.psallidopoulos , h.c. lane , l.thompson , m.baseler , f.massari , c.h.fox , n.p.salzman , and a.s.fauci , science 245 : 305-308 , 1989 ) .
16,19 G#cell_type

production of hiv-1 from latently infected cells requires host cell activation by t-cell mitogens ( t.folks , d.m.powell , m.m.lightfoote , s.benn , m.a. martin , and a.s.fauci , science 231 : 600-602 , 1986 ; d.zagury , j. bernard , r.leonard , r.cheynier , m.feldman , p.s.sarin , and r.c. gallo , science 231 : 850-853 , 1986 ) .
12,14 G#protein

this activation is mediated by the host transcription factor nf-kappa b [ g.nabel and d.baltimore , nature ( london ) 326 : 711-717 , 1987 ] .
6,9 G#protein|9,11 G#protein

we report here that the hiv-1 -encoded nef protein inhibits the induction of nf-kappa b dna-binding activity by t-Â cell mitogens .
5,9 G#protein|13,15 G#protein|18,20 G#protein

however , nef does not affect the dna-binding activity of other transcription factors implicated in hiv-1 regulation , including sp-1 , usf , urs , and nf-at .
2,3 G#protein|11,13 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|21,22 G#protein|23,24 G#protein|26,27 G#protein

additionally , nef inhibits the induction of hiv-1- and interleukin 2- directed gene expression , and the effect on hiv-1 transcription depends on an intact nf-kappa b -binding site .
2,3 G#protein|25,27 G#protein|25,29 G#DNA

these results indicate that defective recruitment of nf-kappa b may underlie nef 's negative transcriptional effects on the hiv-1 and interleukin 2 promoters .
7,9 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|18,23 G#DNA

further evidence suggests that nef inhibits nf-kappa b induction by interfering with a signal derived from the t-cell receptor complex .

expression of c-fos , c-jun and jun b in peripheral blood lymphocytes from young and elderly adults .
2,3 G#DNA|4,5 G#DNA|6,8 G#DNA

the expression of c-fos , c-jun and jun b proto-oncogenes was studied in phytohemagglutinin ( pha ) activated peripheral blood lymphocytes ( pbl ) from young and aged humans .
3,10 G#DNA|13,14 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|13,21 G#cell_line|22,23 G#cell_type

specific mrnas for c-fos and c-jun were detectable within 30 min after cell activation and reached maximal levels within 2 h .
1,2 G#RNA|3,4 G#DNA|5,6 G#DNA

both c-fos and jun b mrnas decreased to pre-activation levels within 6 h , while c-jun mrna remained elevated .
1,2 G#RNA|3,6 G#RNA|1,6 G#RNA|15,17 G#RNA

in pha -activated pbl , no age-related differences were observed in c-fos or jun b mrna expression .
1,2 G#protein|1,4 G#cell_line

however , c-jun mrna levels decreased significantly ( 1.73 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.16 +/- 0.09 arbitrary units , p &lt; 0.01 , young vs. old ) in pbl from elderly individuals activated with pha .
2,4 G#RNA|27,28 G#cell_type|33,34 G#protein

because previous work has demonstrated that t cells from elderly individuals may display normal proliferative responses when activated via the anti-cd2 pathway , c-jun and jun b mrna expression was also studied in anti-cd2-activated purified t cells .
6,8 G#cell_type|20,21 G#protein|35,37 G#cell_type|33,37 G#cell_line

no age-related differences were found in the expression of either of these two proto-oncogenes by anti-cd2 activated t cells .
13,14 G#DNA

these results suggest that the decreased il-2 production and proliferative response displayed by pha -activated pbl from elderly adults may be related to age-related changes in c-jun mrna expression and in the ratio of c-fos to c-jun mrna .

oct2 transactivation from a remote enhancer position requires a b-cell-restricted activity .
0,1 G#protein|4,7 G#DNA

previous cotransfection experiments had demonstrated that ectopic expression of the lymphocyte-specific transcription factor oct2 could efficiently activate a promoter containing an octamer motif .
10,13 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|18,19 G#DNA|21,23 G#DNA

oct2 expression was unable to stimulate a multimerized octamer enhancer element in hela cells , however .
0,1 G#protein|7,11 G#DNA|12,14 G#cell_line

we have tested a variety of oct2 isoforms generated by alternative splicing for the capability to activate an octamer enhancer in nonlymphoid cells and a b-cell line .
6,8 G#protein|18,20 G#DNA|21,23 G#cell_type|25,27 G#cell_line

our analyses show that several oct2 isoforms can stimulate from a remote position but that this stimulation is restricted to b cells .
5,7 G#protein|20,22 G#cell_type

this result indicates the involvement of either a b-cell-specific cofactor or a specific modification of a cofactor or the oct2 protein in oct2 -mediated enhancer activation .
8,10 G#protein|16,17 G#protein|19,21 G#protein|22,23 G#protein

mutational analyses indicate that the carboxy-terminal domain of oct2 is critical for enhancer activation .
5,7 G#protein|8,9 G#protein

moreover , this domain conferred enhancing activity when fused to the oct1 protein , which by itself was unable to stimulate from a remote position .
11,13 G#protein

the glutamine-rich activation domain present in the amino-terminal portion of oct2 and the pou domain contribute only marginally to the transactivation function from a distal position .
1,4 G#protein|10,11 G#protein|7,11 G#protein|13,15 G#protein

the promoter of the cd19 gene is a target for the b-cell-specific transcription factor bsap .
1,2 G#DNA|4,6 G#DNA|11,14 G#protein|14,15 G#protein

the cd19 protein is expressed on the surface of all b-lymphoid cells with the exception of terminally differentiated plasma cells and has been implicated as a signal-transducing receptor in the control of proliferation and differentiation .
1,3 G#protein|10,12 G#cell_type|16,20 G#cell_type

here we demonstrate complete correlation between the expression pattern of the cd19 gene and the b-cell-specific transcription factor bsap in a large panel of b-lymphoid cell lines .
11,13 G#DNA|15,18 G#protein|18,19 G#protein|24,27 G#cell_line

the human cd19 gene has been cloned , and several bsap -binding sites have been mapped by in vitro protein-dna binding studies .
2,4 G#DNA|1,4 G#DNA|10,11 G#protein|10,13 G#DNA

in particular , a high-affinity bsap-binding site instead of a tata sequence is located in the -30 promoter region upstream of a cluster of heterogeneous transcription start sites .
4,7 G#DNA|10,12 G#DNA|16,19 G#DNA|24,28 G#DNA

moreover , this site is occupied by bsap in vivo in a cd19-expressing b-cell line but not in plasma or hela cells .
7,8 G#protein|13,15 G#cell_line|12,15 G#cell_line|18,19 G#cell_type|20,22 G#cell_line

this high-affinity site has been conserved in the promoters of both human and mouse cd19 genes and was furthermore shown to confer b-cell specificity to a beta-globin reporter gene in transient transfection experiments .
1,3 G#DNA|8,9 G#DNA|11,16 G#DNA

in addition , bsap was found to be the only abundant dna-binding activity of b-cell nuclear extracts that interacts with the cd19 promoter .
3,4 G#protein|21,23 G#DNA

together , this evidence strongly implicates bsap in the regulation of the cd19 gene .

eicosanoids in breast cancer patients before and after mastectomy .


in 19 patients with a malignant breast tumor , tumor tissue and blood were taken to determine the eicosanoid profile and platelet aggregation .
21,22 G#cell_type

values were compared with those of patients with benign tumors ( n = 4 ) , or undergoing a mammary reduction ( n = 7 ) .


postoperatively , blood was taken as well in order to compare pre- and postoperative values .


eicosanoids were measured in peripheral blood monocytes and mammary tissue by means of hplc ; furthermore , txa2 , 6-keto-pgf1 alpha , and pge2 were determined by ria .
4,7 G#cell_type

differences in pre- and postoperative values of cancer patients were seen in plasma ria values : pge2 and 6-k-pgf1 alpha were significantly higher preoperatively when compared with postoperatively , however , such differences were seen in the control groups as well .


compared to benign tumor or mammary reduction test material the eicosanoid profile of tissue obtained from malignant mammary tumors showed important differences .


except for pgf2 alpha , hht and 15-hete no detectable quantities of eicosanoids were found in the non-tumor material , whereas in the malignant tumor material substantial quantities of a number of eicosanoid metabolites were present .


statistically significant correlations could be established between patient/histopathology data and the results of the platelet aggregation assays , e.g. between menopausal status and adp aggregation ; oestrogen receptor ( +/- ) and collagen and arachidonic acid aggregation , inflammatory cell infiltration score and arachidonic acid aggregation and fibrosis score and adp aggregation .
14,15 G#cell_type|26,28 G#protein|32,33 G#protein

the results show that eicosanoid synthesis in material from mammary cancer patients is different from that in benign mammary tissue .


the implications , in particular , in relation to future prognosis of the patient , remain obscure .


mineralocorticoids and mineralocorticoid receptors in mononuclear leukocytes in patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension .
2,4 G#protein|5,7 G#cell_type

to examine the role of mineralocorticoids in the pathophysiology of pregnancy-induced hypertension ( pih ) , we studied plasma aldosterone and 18-hydroxycorticosterone levels in 25 women with pih and 25 normal pregnant women , as controls .


furthermore , we evaluated the mineralocorticoid receptor ( mr ) status in mononuclear leukocytes in the 2 groups .
5,7 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|12,14 G#cell_type

mr count was significantly ( p less than 0.0005 ) decreased in the pih group ( 148 +/- 9 binding sites/cell ) compared with the control group ( 300 +/- 17 binding sites/cell ; mean +/- sem ) .
0,1 G#protein

plasma aldosterone in women with pih was 281 +/- 61 pmol/l ; in normal pregnant women it was 697 +/- 172 pmol/l ( p less than 0.025 ) .


plasma 18-hydroxycorticosterone was also significantly ( p less than 0.025 ) lower ( pih , 1071 +/- 149 pmol/l ; controls , 1907 +/- 318 pmol/l ) .


these values were determined at the onset of clinical symptoms of pih .


these results can not be explained by receptor down-regulation due to higher levels of mineralocorticoids in pih ; a hitherto unknown mineralocorticoid may , thus , be responsible for the hypertension and altered mr status .

structure function analysis of vitamin d analogs with c-ring modifications .


analogs of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 ( 1 alpha,25-(oh) 2d3 ) with substitutions on c-11 were synthesized .


small apolar substitutions ( 11 alpha-methyl , 11 alpha-fluoromethyl ) did not markedly decrease the affinity for the vitamin d receptor , but larger ( 11 alpha-chloromethyl or 11 alpha- or 11 beta-phenyl ) or more polar substitutions ( 11 alpha-hydroxymethyl , 11 alpha-(2-hydroxyethyl ] decreased the affinity to less than 5 % of that of 1 alpha,25-oh)2d3 .
18,21 G#protein

their affinity for the vitamin d -binding protein , however , increased up to 4-fold .
4,8 G#protein

the biological activity of 11 alpha-methyl-1 alpha,25-(oh)2d3 closely resembled that of the natural hormone on normal and leukemic cell proliferation and bone resorption , whereas its in vivo effect on calcium metabolism of the rachitic chick was about 50 % of that of 1 alpha,25-(oh)2d3 .
17,19 G#cell_type

the 11 beta-methyl analog had a greater than 10-fold lower activity .


the differentiating effects of the other c-11 analogs on human promyeloid leukemia cells ( hl-60 ) agreed well with their bone-resorbing activity and receptor affinity , but they demonstrated lower calcemic effects in vivo .
9,13 G#cell_line|14,15 G#cell_line

large or polar substitutions on c-11 of 1 alpha,25-(oh)2d3 thus impair the binding of the vitamin d receptor but increase the affinity to vitamin d-binding protein .
15,18 G#protein|23,26 G#protein

the effects of many c-11-substituted 1 alpha,25-(oh)2d3 analogs on hl-60 cell differentiation exceeded their activity on calcium metabolism .

glucocorticoid receptor binding in three different cell types in major depressive disorder : lack of evidence of receptor binding defect .
0,2 G#protein

1 .


in order to further understand the apparent glucocorticoid resistance in major depressive disorder , circadian variation in cortisol concentration , dexamethasone suppression and glucocorticoid receptor binding in mononuclear leukocytes , polymorphonuclear leukocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts were measured in rigidly defined major depressive disorder patients and non-depressed psychiatric controls .
27,29 G#cell_type|30,32 G#cell_type|33,36 G#cell_line

2 .


mononuclear leukocytes binding to glucocorticoid correlated significantly with polymorphonuclear leukocytes binding to glucocorticoid , but both determinations failed to differentiate major depressive disorder and control subjects .
0,2 G#cell_type|8,10 G#cell_type

3 .


initial and post- dexamethasone in vitro fibroblast binding to glucocorticoid was not different between major depressive disorder and non-depressed control subjects .


4 .


the phenomenon of glucocorticoid resistance in major depressive disorder remains unexplained .

in vitro effects of aldosterone on the intracellular concentrations of sodium , potassium and calcium , cell volume and the sodium -proton-antiport have been described in intact human mononuclear leukocytes ( hml ) .
